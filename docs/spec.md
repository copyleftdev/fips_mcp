# Go 1.24 FIPS 140-3 Cryptography Support and MCP Server Compliance Design

## Go 1.24 FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Libraries and APIs

Go 1.24 introduces native FIPS 140-3 support through the **Go Cryptographic Module v1.0.0**, which implements FIPS-approved algorithms in the standard library. Public crypto APIs (e.g. `crypto/ecdsa`, `crypto/rand`, `crypto/tls`, etc.) transparently use this module when FIPS mode is enabled. This means existing code can become FIPS-compliant without major changes, as long as it uses Go’s built-in crypto libraries (no custom or non-standard crypto). Key Go 1.24 crypto components and their FIPS relevance include:

* **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** – Use Go’s `crypto/tls` for all network encryption. In Go 1.24, `crypto/tls` automatically utilizes the FIPS-validated crypto module for ciphers and handshakes. By default, only approved TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 and 1.3 with strong cipher suites) should be used. Unless a dependency embeds its own TLS implementation, using Go’s `net/http` and `crypto/tls` ensures the server’s communications rely on FIPS-validated cryptography. We will configure the TLS settings to allow **only FIPS-approved cipher suites** and algorithms for compliance.

* **Random Number Generation & Key Generation** – Use `crypto/rand` for all cryptographic randomness (e.g. key generation, nonces). In FIPS mode, Go’s RNG performs an integrity self-check at startup and continuously mixes in system entropy to meet FIPS requirements. This ensures keys and secrets are generated with a compliant CSPRNG. For key management, the server will use Go’s standard libraries (`crypto/rsa`, `crypto/ecdsa`, etc.) to generate and handle keys, as these invoke FIPS-approved algorithms under the hood. Secure key storage is also critical – keys and certs will be stored in memory only or in secure stores as appropriate (e.g. using OS keyrings or encrypted files if persistent storage is needed), to align with *secure key management* practices mandated by FIPS 140-3.

* **Hashing and Encryption** – Use Go’s `crypto` package implementations for all cryptographic primitives. Algorithms like SHA-256 (`crypto/sha256`), SHA-384/512, AES (`crypto/aes`), and RSA/ECDSA are implemented in the FIPS module. Non-FIPS algorithms (e.g. MD5, SHA-1, RC4) are either not available or will be disabled in strict FIPS mode. In fact, if `GODEBUG=fips140=only` is set, any attempt to use a non-compliant algorithm will return an error or panic. This guarantees the MCP server does not accidentally use disallowed algorithms. The design will avoid any deprecated algorithms and stick to approved ones (AES for encryption, SHA-2 family for hashing, HMAC-SHA-2 for MAC, etc.), all of which are provided by Go’s standard libraries in FIPS 140-3 mode.

* **Crypto Module APIs** – Go 1.24 provides a few APIs to manage FIPS mode. We will build the server with `GOFIPS140=v1.0.0` or `GOFIPS140=latest` to link against the FIPS module. At runtime, we will enable FIPS mode via `GODEBUG=fips140=on` (or `=only` for extra strictness) so that the Go Cryptographic Module operates in FIPS 140-3 mode. The `crypto/fips140.Enabled()` function can be used on startup to verify that the server is indeed running in FIPS mode. If the server is started in a non-compliant environment (e.g. on an unsupported platform), it will log an error and refuse to run in compliance mode. This two-level mechanism (build-time and run-time) ensures the binary is built with a FIPS-validated crypto module and that it’s activated during execution.

* **Auditing and Logging** – While not a specific Go crypto library, **audit logging** is an important part of compliance. FIPS 140-3 guidelines emphasize rigorous self-testing and also encourage secure logging of cryptographic operations and management activities. Our design includes an **Audit Logger module** (see below) to record security-relevant events: for example, TLS handshakes, key generation events, administrative commands, and any invocation of sensitive operations. These logs will be written to a protected log store to prevent tampering, creating a clear audit trail of access attempts and crypto events. The audit log helps demonstrate compliance (e.g. showing that only approved algorithms were used, recording any errors or self-test failures) and would be invaluable for governance reviews.

By relying on Go 1.24’s standard crypto libraries in FIPS mode, we map our implementation directly to FIPS 140-3 requirements. FIPS 140-3 requires using *approved algorithms, secure key management, and rigorous self-testing*. Go’s native FIPS module addresses these: only approved ciphers/hashes are available, keys are generated with proper entropy, and the module performs integrity self-checks at initialization. Additionally, the module’s validation (under CMVP lab testing) provides assurance that it meets FIPS 140-3 standards. In summary, for cryptographic functionality the MCP server will use:

* **Go Standard Library Crypto** – Leverages FIPS 140-3 validated implementations (for TLS, encryption, hashing, RNG, signatures, etc.).
* **FIPS Mode Configuration** – Ensure the binary and runtime are configured for FIPS (using `GOFIPS140` build flag and `GODEBUG=fips140` at runtime).
* **Approved Protocols** – Enforce TLS 1.2+/approved cipher suites for all external communication.
* **Key Management** – Use FIPS-approved algorithms for key generation; protect private keys and secrets in memory; optionally integrate with HSM or OS secure storage if required by the deployment.
* **Audit Logging** – Provide secure logging of cryptographic and access events to satisfy auditing requirements.

## Anthropic MCP Schema: Mandatory Protocol & Structural Requirements

To be fully compliant with Anthropic’s **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** schema (latest version as of 2025-03-26), our server must implement all required protocol elements defined in the official specification. The MCP is built on a JSON-RPC 2.0 foundation, with additional conventions for session management and feature exposure. **Core mandatory requirements** for any compliant MCP server include:

* **JSON-RPC 2.0 Messaging** – All communication between client (AI assistant host) and server must use JSON-RPC 2.0 message format. Every request must include a unique ID (non-null, not reused), a method name, and parameters; responses must echo the request ID and contain either a result or an error object. The server **MUST** follow JSON-RPC exactly as specified: e.g. return a well-formed error (code, message) for any failed request. Notifications (one-way messages without response) are also allowed for certain events. In practice, our server’s Protocol Handler will marshal/unmarshal JSON and enforce these rules (e.g. rejecting messages with duplicate IDs or invalid format). This base protocol compliance is non-negotiable: *“All implementations MUST support the base protocol”*.

* **Connection Lifecycle (Handshake)** – MCP defines a precise initialization handshake that every server must implement. The sequence is: **(1)** Client sends an `initialize` request to begin a session (this is the first message of any session). The initialize params include the protocol version the client supports and the client’s capability set. **(2)** The server responds to `initialize` with its own details: it must confirm the agreed protocol version (choosing one if multiple are supported) and advertise the server’s capabilities/features. For example, the server’s response will include fields describing which MCP features it provides (resources, prompts, tools) and any sub-capabilities or options. **(3)** After a successful response, the client sends an `initialized` notification to signal that it is ready to proceed. Only after this handshake is complete can normal operations occur – no other requests should be processed until then. Our server must strictly adhere to this flow: the `initialize` request **MUST NOT** be part of a batch and must be handled first. If the protocol versions are incompatible, the server should respond with an error or an alternative version it supports. In summary, a compliant server must perform capability negotiation and version agreement at startup as defined by the schema.

* **Capability Advertisement** – During initialization, the server and client exchange **capability objects** to decide which optional features will be used. Our server’s initialize response will include a structure listing its capabilities (e.g. `"resources": true` if it offers the Resource feature, `"tools": true`, etc., along with any flags for sub-features). The spec defines certain flags like `listChanged` (to indicate support for change notifications on resource/tool lists). A compliant server should list any *experimental* or extended features under an `"experimental"` capability if applicable. We will ensure our server advertises capabilities strictly per the schema so the client knows exactly what is supported. If a feature is not implemented, it will be omitted or set to false in the capabilities. This negotiation step is crucial for interoperability, as the client will enable or disable certain interactions based on the server’s advertised capabilities.

* **MCP Feature Support** – After initialization, the server enters the **operation phase**, where it can service requests for the features it provides. The MCP schema defines three main *Server Features*: **Resources**, **Prompts**, and **Tools**. A given server may implement any subset of these, but to be “fully compliant” with the spec it should handle them according to the standard schema definitions. Our design will modularize these features (so servers can include what they need), but the *protocol structure* for each feature must follow Anthropic’s schema:

  * **Resources** – Provide contextual data (files, database entries, etc.) to the client/LLM. If the server supports resources, it MUST implement the standard RPC methods to list and fetch resources. For example, clients discover available resources by calling the `resources/list` method. Our server will handle `resources/list` requests by returning a paginated list of resource descriptors (with unique URI identifiers for each resource). There is typically also a `resources/read` (or similar) method to retrieve the content of a resource; the schema likely defines that as well (e.g. `resources/read` to get file contents). The server should use standardized URI formats for resources (e.g. file paths as `file://` URIs, database entries as custom URNs, etc., as appropriate). If resources can change (e.g. files added), the server can send `notifications/resources/list_changed` events to the client, but only if it advertised `listChanged` capability. In summary, a compliant implementation of Resources must: respond correctly to listing and retrieval requests, use the schema’s data structures (URI identifiers, etc.), and enforce any access controls or filtering as needed (the spec leaves actual auth policy to the implementer). Our Resource module will ensure all this, enabling an AI client to browse and fetch context data safely.

  * **Prompts** – Provide predefined prompt templates or system instructions that the client can use. If implemented, the server must support listing available prompts (`prompts/list`) and retrieving a prompt’s content. The client may also supply arguments to customize prompts, so the server should handle parameters (the schema likely has a `prompts/get` or similar where a prompt ID plus arguments yields the final text). We’ll maintain a library of prompt templates (each with an ID, description, and template text). The server’s response to `prompts/list` will enumerate these templates with their metadata. If the list can change (templates added/removed), it should notify via `prompts/list_changed` events (again if `listChanged` capability is true). Even if our particular MCP server doesn’t need prompts, the **structural requirement** is that if it does advertise prompts, it must conform exactly to the MCP schema’s format for prompt definitions and RPC methods. This ensures any MCP-compliant client can fetch and use the prompts as intended.

  * **Tools** – Expose functions or actions that the AI assistant can invoke (arbitrary code execution or queries via the server). For each tool, the server defines a name and a metadata description (what it does, parameters). A compliant server offering tools must implement the standard tool RPCs: `tools/list` to list all available tools (with names and metadata), and `tools/call` (or `tools/execute`) to invoke a specific tool by name with provided arguments. Our server’s Tool module will register available operations (for example, a “searchDatabase” tool or “runShellCommand” tool, depending on the server’s purpose) and will ensure the call semantics match the schema. The request for calling a tool will look like: `{ "method": "tools/call", "params": { "name": "<toolName>", "arguments": {…} } }` and the server must return the result or an error from the tool execution. Importantly, the server should handle tool invocation carefully (with proper sandboxing or restrictions) because tools can be powerful. The MCP spec notes that *tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with caution*; our implementation will include safety checks and require explicit user consent for dangerous actions (as Anthropic’s trust principles recommend). Structurally, to be compliant, the server just needs to follow the MCP tool schema: advertise tools with correct metadata and handle the `tools/list` and `tools/call` RPCs exactly as defined.

* **Error Handling and Logging** – The MCP schema mandates a unified error format (as per JSON-RPC). Our server will use defined JSON-RPC error codes and messages for any failures (e.g. if a tool name is not found, return a JSON-RPC error with an appropriate code). Additionally, for auditing and debugging, we will log protocol events. The server should log significant actions (especially in a secure environment) – e.g., log incoming `initialize` requests (with requested version), any capability negotiation outcome, and any critical errors or security events. This is partly a design choice, but aligns with best practices and helps in compliance audits.

* **Graceful Shutdown** – The protocol defines a shutdown phase for clean termination. While the MCP spec (2025 revision) does not require a specific `shutdown` JSON-RPC message (unlike earlier versions or LSP), it specifies that one side (usually the client) will indicate closure by closing the connection or terminating the process. Our server must handle shutdown gracefully: if using the stdio transport, when the client closes the stdin or sends an OS signal, the server should exit cleanly; if using HTTP/SSE, when the client closes the event stream or HTTP connection, the server should release resources for that session. We will implement proper cleanup routines so that any open file handles, network connections, or goroutines for a session are closed when the session ends. This prevents resource leaks and ensures a predictable lifecycle (which is important for compliance and stability).

* **Standard Transports** – According to the latest MCP spec, two transport mechanisms are supported: **stdio** and **streamable HTTP** (HTTP + SSE). A compliant server should implement at least one of these in the standard way. For **local deployments**, the stdio transport is used (the server process reads JSON-RPC requests on stdin and writes responses to stdout, similar to how Language Server Protocol works). For **remote deployments**, the **streamable HTTP** transport is typically used. In streamable HTTP, the client connects via an HTTP POST request and the server upgrades to a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream to push responses and notifications. Our server will include an HTTP(S) listener that conforms to this pattern:

  * The client initiates a session by POSTing to the server’s endpoint (likely at `/mcp` or similar). If the client’s `Accept` header includes `text/event-stream`, the server can switch to an SSE stream in the response. We will implement the handshake such that: the HTTP response is held open, with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, and the server sends JSON-RPC responses/events as SSE data frames.
  * The server must ensure each original JSON-RPC request gets exactly one corresponding response on the SSE stream (as per JSON-RPC semantics). It can also send spontaneous server->client messages (requests or notifications) over the stream if needed (for example, a `tools/list_changed` notification). We will follow the spec’s guidelines that the server **should not** close the SSE stream until all outstanding responses are sent, and that either side may close the stream at any time after (to terminate the session).
  * If the server does not support SSE or chooses not to use it, it can instead respond to the POST with a single JSON object (non-streaming). However, to be fully compliant and to support asynchronous operations, we will support the SSE mode. We will also handle multiple streams if the client opens more than one (though usually one stream per session is typical). The spec notes that if multiple SSE connections exist, the server must send each message on only one stream (no duplicate broadcasts) – our design will keep track of connections to enforce this.
  * **Note:** All HTTP communication will be secured with TLS (using our FIPS-compliant `crypto/tls` setup), especially in cloud or multi-tenant scenarios. Additionally, if authentication is required (the MCP spec has an *Authorization* section for securing servers), we will integrate that (e.g. API tokens or mutual TLS) – this ensures only authorized clients can connect to the MCP server.

To summarize the protocol compliance: **every MCP server must implement the JSON-RPC based request/response structure, perform the init handshake and capability negotiation, and then serve the defined feature methods (resources, prompts, tools) in accordance with the JSON schema**. Our server will strictly follow Anthropic’s MCP schema definitions for message formats and workflows, ensuring compatibility with any MCP client. All required fields, method names, and behaviors will match the spec’s latest revision. This guarantees that our server can register with Anthropic’s ecosystem (and e.g. be listed in the MCP registry) as a *compliant MCP server*.

## Design Specification for an MCP Server (FIPS-Compliant, Schema-Compliant)

To implement the above, we propose a clear modular design for the MCP server. The server will be built in Go 1.24, leveraging its FIPS 140-3 cryptographic support, and structured into logical components for maintainability and security. The major modules and their responsibilities are:

* **Cryptography Engine Module**: Initializes and manages all cryptographic settings for the server. This module will enable Go’s FIPS mode (e.g. setting up environment or programmatic checks) at startup and configure TLS. It will load the server’s TLS certificate and key (which should be generated or stored in a FIPS-compliant manner, using strong algorithms like ECDSA or RSA 3072). The crypto engine will ensure that the `tls.Config` is restricted to FIPS-approved cipher suites and protocols. It also exposes utilities for other modules, e.g. a function to get secure random bytes (`crypto/rand.Reader`) for any need within tools or resources. By centralizing this, we ensure all cryptographic operations go through one vetted path. This module will also run any self-tests if needed (though Go’s runtime does most automatically). If the underlying Go crypto module fails its integrity check on startup, this module will detect it and abort launch (ensuring we don’t run in a non-compliant state). Essentially, the Crypto Engine acts as the server’s **FIPS enforcement guard** – it makes “secure by default” easy for the rest of the code.

* **Protocol Handler (JSON-RPC Layer)**: This is the core that receives JSON-RPC messages (from either stdio or HTTP/SSE), parses them, and dispatches to the appropriate feature module. It will implement the **Lifecycle** logic: on a new connection, wait for `initialize`, then call an internal handler to negotiate version and capabilities. We’ll likely create a data structure to represent a session (tracking things like negotiated version, client ID if any, and the active capabilities for that session). The Protocol Handler sends the `initialize` response by gathering info from feature modules (each module can contribute its capability flags and any server info, like a name/version of the server software). Once initialization is done (and the client’s `initialized` notification is received), the handler enters the main loop of processing requests. For each incoming request:

  * It verifies the JSON-RPC format (non-null ID, valid method name string, etc.).
  * It routes the request to the correct module based on the method namespace. For example, methods starting with `resources/` go to the Resource Manager, `tools/` to Tool Executor, `prompts/` to Prompt Manager, etc. Lifecycle methods (like `initialize`) are handled internally by the Protocol Handler itself.
  * It collects the result or error from the module and formulates the JSON-RPC response. If a module needs to send asynchronous notifications (e.g. `.../list_changed`), it will call back into the Protocol Handler’s send function, which writes the notification over the transport.
  * The Protocol Handler also implements **error handling**: if a request method is not recognized or a module returns an error, it formats a proper JSON-RPC error response with code and message as defined by MCP (the spec likely enumerates some error codes for things like UnknownMethod, InvalidParams, etc.).
  * Additionally, the handler manages **batched requests** (JSON-RPC can batch multiple requests in an array). It will iterate and handle each, sending back a batch of responses.
  * Finally, for shutting down, the Protocol Handler will listen for a termination signal (EOF on stdio, or context cancellation on HTTP) and initiate cleanup with the other modules.

  This module is essentially the **glue** between the network layer and the feature logic. It ensures the **structural compliance** with JSON-RPC and MCP session rules, so feature modules can focus on their domain logic.

* **Resource Manager Module**: Responsible for implementing the **Resources** feature (if enabled). It manages the data sources that the server exposes. For a file-system backed MCP server, the Resource Manager might handle file paths, performing file I/O for read requests and directory traversal for list requests. For a database-backed server, it could enumerate database schemas or queries. This module will:

  * Maintain an index or registry of available resources (and map them to their URIs).
  * Implement the `resources/list` method handler: possibly supporting pagination parameters, it returns a list of resource descriptors (each descriptor might include a URI, a type or MIME, size, etc., per schema).
  * Implement the `resources/read` (or equivalent) method: retrieving the actual content or data of a specified resource URI. It will enforce any access control (for example, if certain files or data should be restricted, it checks permissions).
  * If applicable, watch for changes (e.g. file changes) and trigger `resources/list_changed` notifications to the client. This can be done via filesystem notifications or polling, depending on context. The capability for this will only be set if we implement it.
  * Sanitize and validate all resource outputs (e.g. limit sizes if needed, to avoid overwhelming the client).
  * Potentially implement **caching** if data reads are heavy, though cache invalidation must be handled carefully if the underlying data can change.

  The Resource Manager ties into the Crypto Engine for any data that needs encryption or decryption (for instance, if serving encrypted files, it would call Crypto Engine to decrypt content). It also will call the Audit Logger to record resource access events (e.g. “client X read file Y at time Z”). This provides a security trail and helps meet compliance for data access transparency.

* **Prompt Manager Module**: (If prompts feature is used) Manages a set of pre-defined prompt templates that the server offers. It might simply load prompt definitions from a JSON/YAML file or embed them in code. Each prompt has an ID, a description, the template text, and perhaps a schema for parameters it accepts. This module will:

  * Handle `prompts/list` requests by returning all available prompt IDs and metadata.
  * Handle a `prompts/get` or `prompts/apply` request (depending on schema) to fetch the full template text, possibly substituting any arguments provided by the client. For example, a prompt might be “Translate the following text to French: {{text}}”; the client can request that prompt with an argument for `text`.
  * Ensure that prompts are delivered exactly as stored and that any user-provided inputs to a prompt are safely inserted (to avoid prompt injection issues). Essentially, it should treat prompt templates as static content and insert parameters in a controlled way (likely the MCP client or SDK does templating, but if the server does, it must be careful).
  * This module can be relatively simple, but it provides a convenient way to package expert instructions or query patterns that the AI can use. It too can log when a prompt is provided (for audit, especially if some prompts trigger sensitive actions).

  If our particular server doesn’t need custom prompts, this module can be disabled. But the design includes it for completeness, and to allow easily adding prompt support if needed down the line without altering core logic.

* **Tool Executor Module**: Implements the **Tools** feature, enabling active operations. This is one of the most powerful parts of an MCP server. The Tool Executor will maintain a registry of available tool functions. For each tool, we’ll define:

  * A **name** (string identifier used in the `tools/call` RPC),
  * Metadata like description and an input/output schema or parameter list (to be returned in `tools/list`).
  * A handler function that executes the tool’s action.

  The module will handle `tools/list` by returning the catalog of tool names and descriptions. For `tools/call`, it will lookup the tool by name, validate the incoming arguments, and then invoke the corresponding handler. After execution, it formats the result to return to the client. We will design this carefully to maintain **security**:

  * If a tool might perform a privileged action (like reading system info or modifying something), we will ensure the host (client side) obtained user consent before enabling this (as recommended by Anthropic’s guidelines). The server might enforce some checks too (for example, refusing to execute certain tools until an unlock token is provided, depending on design).
  * The execution environment for tools should be sandboxed or limited. For instance, if a tool runs shell commands, we will restrict it to allowed commands and use a locked-down subprocess environment.
  * Any errors or exceptions during tool execution will be caught, and a sanitized error message will be returned via JSON-RPC error.
  * The Tool Executor can also push intermediate results or progress via notifications if a tool is long-running (the MCP spec mentions *progress tracking* as a utility feature). We might implement progress updates as `notifications/tools/progress` events, if needed, to inform the client.

  Like others, this module logs its actions via the Audit Logger (e.g. “Tool X invoked by client, returned success/failure”). This is important since tools can change state or perform transactions – having a record is crucial in regulated environments. By structuring tools in one module, we make it easy to add or remove tools based on deployment (for example, some deployments might not allow a “shell” tool for security – we can omit it without affecting other parts of the server).

* **Audit Logger Module**: Cross-cutting component to record events and ensure compliance with auditing requirements. Every sensitive action or error triggers an entry here. The Audit Logger will timestamp and store events such as:

  * Session start/stop (with which user or client connected, if known),
  * Successful and failed `initialize` handshakes (including the chosen protocol version and capabilities negotiated),
  * Resource accesses (which resource URI was requested),
  * Tool invocations (which tool, and outcome),
  * Security events (e.g. invalid auth token presented, encryption errors, any self-test failure from the crypto module),
  * Possibly the content of prompts delivered (or at least which prompt ID was used).

  These logs will be written to a secure location. For local deployments, it could be a file protected by OS permissions. In cloud deployments, it might integrate with a centralized logging system or SIEM. We will ensure logs are protected from unauthorized access – for example, using file permissions, or even encrypting the log file with a key (though that key management adds complexity). Since FIPS 140-3 emphasizes *secure logging of management activities*, our logger is designed to meet that: it will make logs **append-only** (to prevent tampering), and we could include a cryptographic hash or signature per log entry or per file to detect tampering (if needed for high assurance). The audit log can be rotated and archived according to organizational policy. This module will provide interfaces for other modules to write events easily, so adding new log events is straightforward (e.g. `Audit.LogToolCall(toolName, user, success)`).

* **Transport Layer / Interface Module**: This part of the server handles the input/output interface according to the environment (Local or HTTP). We will likely have an abstraction such that the Protocol Handler doesn’t need to worry if messages come from stdio or from an HTTP connection – the Transport module provides a unified stream of incoming messages and a way to send outgoing messages. Concretely:

  * For **local mode**, the transport will be an STDIO reader/writer. We’ll parse lines or length-prefixed messages from stdin (the MCP SDK likely sends each JSON message on a separate line or with some framing). The transport module feeds these into the Protocol Handler. Outgoing messages from the Protocol Handler are written to stdout. We have to be careful to flush output promptly and maybe to handle partial messages. If needed, we might incorporate a simple framing (like each JSON message followed by a newline, as common).
  * For **HTTP mode**, we will use Go’s HTTP server to listen on a port (likely configurable). The transport module will handle the HTTP request: e.g. an incoming POST to `/mcp` with potentially some initial data (maybe the first request(s) could be in the body) – as per the spec’s *streamable HTTP* definition, the client may send a batch of requests in the POST body and then expect responses over SSE. Our implementation will read any JSON in the request body as initial messages (and pass them to Protocol Handler), then upgrade the connection to an SSE stream (by sending appropriate headers and keeping the connection open). We will then continually write events to the ResponseWriter in SSE format for each outgoing message. The SSE format typically prepends `data: ` to each line of JSON and ends with a double newline. We’ll ensure to format according to spec and flush after each message so the client receives it immediately. We’ll also handle any reconnection logic if needed (SSE allows clients to reconnect and continue a stream; our server might need to support `Last-Event-ID` headers if we allow resuming, but that may be unnecessary for short-lived sessions).
  * The Transport module will also enforce network security: in cloud mode, we will **require HTTPS**. We’ll obtain or be provided an X.509 certificate for the server. The Crypto Engine (TLS config) plugs in here to provide the certificate and enforce cipher suites. If client authentication is desired (some MCP servers might require an API key or mutual TLS), the transport layer can check an auth token on the HTTP request or require client certs. (The Anthropic MCP spec’s Authorization section likely covers optional API keys or OAuth – we can integrate that if needed by simply validating tokens on incoming connections before allowing the session to proceed).
  * We will design the server to support **both transports** concurrently if needed – e.g. a command-line flag could run it in local-stdio mode vs. networked mode. This gives flexibility for deployment.

* **Configuration & Environment**: Although not a separate code module, it’s worth noting how configuration is handled. The server will have a config file or environment variables to adjust:

  * Which features are enabled (prompts/resources/tools) and their specific settings (e.g. file system path to expose, or credentials for external APIs in tools, etc.).
  * Cryptographic settings such as paths to certs/keys, whether to enforce FIPS-only mode (`GODEBUG=fips140=only`), and whether to allow non-FIPS mode for testing.
  * Logging settings (log level, log output location).
  * Authorization settings (e.g. accepted API keys, allowed origins for clients if remote, etc.).

  For ease of deployment, we might support reading a JSON/YAML config or environment variables. In a compliant deployment, these would be set to enforce security (e.g. pointing to FIPS-approved keys, etc.). The configuration will be loaded at startup by the main program and passed into the modules that need it.

### Mapping Components to FIPS 140-3 and MCP Requirements

Bringing it all together, here’s how each part of the design aligns with FIPS 140-3 compliance and MCP schema compliance:

* **Crypto Engine** – Ensures all cryptographic operations in the server are FIPS 140-3 compliant. This directly addresses FIPS requirements for approved algorithms and self-integrity (via Go’s module). It also manages TLS setup, fulfilling the requirement for FIPS-validated encryption for data in transit. By centralizing crypto, we reduce the chance of any part of the server accidentally using a non-compliant cipher. The Crypto Engine’s configuration (GOFIPS140 and GODEBUG flags) essentially **locks the binary into compliance mode**.

* **Protocol Handler** – Implements the base MCP protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 messages, the init handshake, and session lifecycle) exactly as defined. This guarantees the server adheres to mandatory MCP structure. It enforces unique IDs, proper response formation, etc., so no client will misinterpret our messages. This aligns with the “Base Protocol” must-have in the spec. It also handles **capability negotiation**, ensuring the server and client agree on features and MCP version before proceeding. In terms of FIPS, the Protocol Handler doesn’t directly deal with crypto, but it does ensure that if any sensitive operation is requested (say a tool that uses crypto), it goes through the Crypto Engine.

* **Resource/Prompt/Tool Modules** – These correspond to the optional MCP **Server Features**. By implementing these according to spec (with the correct RPC methods and data schemas), we meet the structural requirements for those features. For instance, returning resource lists with properly formatted URIs and tool lists with proper metadata allows the AI client (Claude or others) to consume them seamlessly. Each module also incorporates compliance considerations:

  * Resource Manager ensures that any data it exposes is authorized (preventing the AI from accessing files it shouldn’t, which is a security requirement). It uses FIPS-approved hashing or encryption if, for example, it needs to verify file integrity or store sensitive data.
  * Tool Executor ensures that tools executions are logged and gated by user consent where appropriate, reflecting Anthropic’s safety principles (which, while not strictly FIPS, are important for a compliant and trustworthy system). If a tool performs cryptographic tasks (e.g. sign a document), it again leverages the Crypto Engine so that even those operations are FIPS compliant.
  * Prompt Manager is more about structure, but it contributes to compliance by ensuring consistent, controlled inputs to the model (reducing risk of prompt-based attacks).

* **Audit Logger** – Maps to the *auditing* aspect of compliance. Many security standards beyond FIPS (like SOC2, FedRAMP, etc.) require audit trails. Even FIPS 140-3 certified solutions often *support secure logging of all management activities*. Our logger provides that support. It helps detect misuse or anomalies (for example, if a tool was invoked unexpectedly or a resource was accessed at odd hours, the logs can reveal that). For FIPS specifically, if there ever were a cryptographic error (like a self-test failure or attempt to use disallowed cipher), we would capture it in the log, which is useful for compliance reviews and forensic analysis. The Audit Logger is also implemented in a secure way (append-only, protected storage) so that it meets the requirement of tamper-evident logging.

* **Transport Layer** – This ensures our server can be deployed in various environments without losing compliance. By supporting STDIO and HTTP(S), we adhere to the official transports in the MCP spec. In local mode, running over stdio avoids network exposure altogether, which is ideal for an **air-gapped or on-device scenario**. In remote mode, using HTTPS with strong crypto meets the requirement of protecting data in transit (which is a part of FIPS and general security best practice). The SSE implementation follows the updated MCP spec (2025-03-26) which replaced the older HTTP+SSE with a refined mechanism, so we remain up-to-date and compatible. The transport also will incorporate any **authorization** needed (for example, checking API keys or OAuth tokens on incoming connections), which ties into compliance if we need to restrict who can connect to the server in a multi-user environment.

* **Deployment Configurations** – Finally, we consider *deployment across Local, Cloud, and “ERGOT” environments*. Our design is flexible to accommodate each:

  * **Local Deployment:** The MCP server can run as a local process on a user’s machine (e.g. launched by Claude Desktop or a developer’s environment). In this case, we would use the stdio transport or bind the HTTP server to `localhost` only. Local deployment gives full hardware control to the user, ideal for sensitive data that shouldn’t leave the machine. We ensure that even in local mode, all cryptography is in FIPS mode (if the machine itself is in a compliant configuration, e.g. using a FIPS-enabled OS build). The server’s footprint is small (just a single Go binary), making it easy to deploy on developer laptops or on-prem servers. We will allow configuration via a local config file so that, for example, a user can specify which directory to expose as resources. One consideration: if the local environment doesn’t have an internet connection (for truly air-gapped setups), our server still functions fully – it does not depend on any cloud service. It uses the local OS for RNG and time, that’s it. So it’s suitable for isolated networks.
  * **Cloud Deployment:** In cloud or server deployments, we run the MCP server as a service (for instance, in a Docker container on Kubernetes or Cloud Run). Here, we will use the HTTP+SSE transport to allow remote AI clients to connect. We must enforce TLS – we’ll integrate with cloud key management to get a TLS cert (or use Let’s Encrypt, etc., depending on the scenario). We also consider scalability: our server is stateless between sessions (each session is handled in memory while active, but there’s no persistent state that carries over except what’s in resources which could be a database). This means we could run multiple instances behind a load balancer to handle many concurrent sessions. We might use a sticky session based on client ID to ensure all requests of one session go to the same instance (since a session isn’t shared across instances unless we add a shared state store). For compliance in cloud, we ensure our container OS is hardened and perhaps FIPS-certified (e.g. RHEL or Ubuntu Core FIPS mode) – though Go’s module covers crypto, the overall system hardening is complementary. We will also integrate cloud monitoring for our audit logs (e.g. sending logs to CloudWatch, Splunk, etc., in a secure manner) so that security teams can monitor usage in real-time. If multi-tenancy is a concern (multiple clients connecting to one server), we can implement authentication tokens for clients and verify them in the Protocol Handler or transport. Cloud deployment also allows us to use hardware entropy sources or even cloud HSM services if needed (though not required, since Go’s crypto is software-based FIPS Level 1, but higher assurance environments might want keys in HSM – the design could accommodate plugging that in for certain key operations via `crypto.Signer` interfaces).
  * **ERGOT Environment Deployment:** Here we interpret “ERGOT” as a highly secure, possibly isolated or government/cloud enclave environment (for example, an **Isolated Regulated Environment**). In such scenarios, compliance and security are paramount. Our server is well-suited to this because:

    * It can run fully offline, with no external dependencies, which is often a requirement in classified or air-gapped networks. The MCP server can be deployed on an isolated network (say, a classified cloud region or a data center with no internet) and still function, serving resources and tools to an AI model that’s also in that environment.
    * We would use **strict FIPS mode** (`GODEBUG=fips140=only`) in these environments to guarantee nothing outside the validated crypto is used. We also might integrate with platform-specific FIPS settings (for example, if the OS has a FIPS mode, ensure it’s on).
    * The Audit Logger becomes crucial – in an ERGOT setting, every action might need to be recorded for compliance. We might enhance it by signing the log records with a key only the security officer has, or writing logs to an append-only system (some systems have audit log appliances).
    * Deployment-wise, we might be on VMs or bare metal in a secure facility. We’ll provide deployment scripts that don’t assume internet connectivity (no pulling of external Docker images at runtime – everything should be pre-loaded).
    * If ERGOT implies a specific government program or environment (for instance, certain clouds or enclaves), we’ll ensure our design meets any extra requirements that come with it – e.g. maybe a specific module for interactivity or a compliance check. But fundamentally, since our server is built with strong crypto and auditing, it should satisfy the common needs of such environments.
    * We also consider **performance**: in restricted envs, resources might be constrained, so our Go server is lightweight (Go’s efficiency and no heavy runtime overhead). It can run on modest hardware without issues, which is sometimes a concern in edge deployments.

* **Project Structure & Repository Layout:** We will organize the code for clarity and to enforce separation of concerns. For example:

  ```
  /cmd/mcpserver/main.go        (entry point, config parsing, launching modules)
  /pkg/crypto/fips.go           (Crypto Engine implementation, FIPS mode checks)
  /pkg/proto/handler.go         (Protocol Handler implementation)
  /pkg/proto/messages.go        (structures for JSON-RPC messages, maybe generated from schema)
  /pkg/resources/manager.go     (Resource Manager)
  /pkg/tools/manager.go         (Tool Executor)
  /pkg/prompts/manager.go       (Prompt Manager)
  /pkg/audit/logger.go          (Audit Logger)
  /pkg/transport/stdio.go       (Stdio transport implementation)
  /pkg/transport/http.go        (HTTP+SSE transport implementation)
  ```

  Each module can be unit-tested in isolation (e.g. feed some fake JSON-RPC to the Protocol Handler and see that it routes correctly, or test that Tool Executor executes a dummy function and returns output). This modular structure also makes it easier to undergo security reviews – auditors can inspect the Crypto module to verify FIPS usage, inspect the Audit module to verify logging, etc., rather than wading through one giant codebase.

* **Compliance Checklist:** To conclude the design spec, we ensure the following checklist is met for rapid, compliant implementation:

  * Use Go 1.24+ with FIPS module, build with `GOFIPS140=v1.0.0` and run with `fips140=on`.
  * Only use Go standard crypto libraries (no custom crypto, no `unsafe` that touches crypto internals).
  * Configure TLS with FIPS-approved settings (e.g. disable TLS 1.1/1.0, prefer AES-GCM ciphers, etc.).
  * Implement MCP JSON schema exactly: correct method names (`initialize`, `resources/list`, `tools/call`, etc.), correct JSON formats and field names.
  * Perform the init handshake and capability negotiation as specified.
  * Implement at least one of {Resources, Prompts, Tools} features (or all that are needed) and if not implementing some, ensure the server does not advertise them. For each implemented feature, pass all required tests (the MCP spec likely has test cases – e.g. responding appropriately to list requests, handling edge cases like an unknown resource ID).
  * Include robust logging and have a plan for protecting those logs.
  * Document the server’s usage and any configuration needed for compliance (for example, instruct users deploying in FIPS-required environments to enable the FIPS mode flags, etc., and how to provision TLS certs).
  * Test the server with Anthropic’s official SDKs (TypeScript/Python SDK) to ensure it registers and functions as expected. Compliance is not just about ticking boxes but also interoperability.

By following this design, we create an MCP server that **meets FIPS 140-3 cryptographic standards and fully adheres to Anthropic’s MCP protocol schema**. Each module serves a clear purpose in achieving security or protocol compliance. The result will be an actionable codebase where developers can quickly implement core functionality (thanks to clear separation) and integrators can deploy it in various environments (local, cloud, or high-security ERGOT setups) with confidence. This design balances security (FIPS crypto, auditing, consent controls) with functionality (rich MCP features) in order to enable rapid development of a compliant, production-ready MCP server.
